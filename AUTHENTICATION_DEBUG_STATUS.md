# Authentication Debugging Summary

## ❌ **Issue Identified**

The user reported: **"Authentication failed: Invalid JSON response from API"**

Looking at the server logs, I can see the authentication endpoints are being called but there are several issues that need to be addressed.

## 🔍 **Log Analysis**

From the Apache logs provided:

### **Successful API Calls:**
- ✅ `/api/passkey/config` - Working correctly
- ✅ API authentication passing with proper permissions
- ✅ Related origins configuration working

### **Failed Authentication Attempts:**
Multiple endpoints being tried suggests the client is not getting proper responses:
- `/api/check-access/by-passkey` 
- `/api/check-access-by-passkey`
- `/api/passkey-check-access`
- `/misc/passkey?action=check-access`

## 🛠 **Fixes Applied**

### **1. Enhanced Error Logging**
- Added comprehensive logging to `handlePasskeyCheckAccess()` method
- Now logs request body, credential presence, user lookup, and verification results
- Will help identify exactly where the authentication is failing

### **2. Multiple Endpoint Support**
- Added support for alternative endpoint patterns the client is trying:
  - `/api/check-access/by-passkey` (primary)
  - `/api/check-access-by-passkey` 
  - `/api/passkey-check-access`

### **3. JSON Response Headers**
- Added explicit `Content-Type: application/json` header
- This should fix the "Invalid JSON response" error

### **4. Database Error Handling**
- Added table existence check before querying `passkey_credentials`
- Enhanced error handling in credential lookup
- Better logging for database operations

## 🧪 **Testing Required**

### **Test 1: Upload Fixed Plugin**
Upload the updated `passkey.php` to the server to get the enhanced logging.

### **Test 2: Check Authentication Logs**
After upload, attempt authentication and check logs for:
- Request body content
- Credential parsing success/failure  
- Database table existence
- User lookup results
- Verification attempts

### **Test 3: Verify JSON Response**
Use the test page `test_auth_endpoint.html` to verify:
- Endpoints are responding with JSON
- Error messages are properly formatted
- API authentication is working

## 🎯 **Expected Root Causes**

Based on the patterns I'm seeing, the likely issues are:

### **1. No Passkey Credentials Exist Yet**
- User may not have created any passkeys yet
- Database table may not exist or be empty
- This would cause "User not found" errors

### **2. WebAuthn Library Issues**  
- The verification logic uses WebAuthn library which may not be properly loaded
- Could cause authentication to fail even with valid credentials

### **3. Incorrect Request Format**
- Client may be sending data in wrong format
- Enhanced logging will show exactly what's being received

## 📋 **Next Steps**

1. **Upload the fixed plugin** with enhanced logging
2. **Test authentication** and check the Apache error logs
3. **Verify JSON responses** using the test tools
4. **Check if any passkeys exist** in the database
5. **Test passkey creation** before authentication

The enhanced logging will provide much more detail about what's failing in the authentication process.

## 🚨 **Critical Fix Summary**

- ✅ Added comprehensive logging for debugging
- ✅ Fixed JSON response headers  
- ✅ Added multiple endpoint pattern support
- ✅ Enhanced database error handling
- ✅ Improved credential lookup with table validation

The next server logs should provide much more detail about the authentication failure!
